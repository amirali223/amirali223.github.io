## Research Interests

Amirali is a Research Associate at the <a href="https://cait.rutgers.edu/"> Center for Advanced Infrastructure and Transportation</a> at Rutgers Univeristy. His research focuses on cyber-physical approaches for: <br><br>
(1) testing and simulation, such as hybrid simulation, for characterization of innovative and sustainable materials and structures, <br>
(2) autonomous damage assessment, by developing digital twins with structural health monitoring and artificial intelligence capabilities, and <br>
(3) developing infrastructure asset investment planning tools for management of existing and new assets that enable infrastructure authorities and municipalities to use monitoring data-driven insights to guide decision making and capital investment planning over the life of an asset.
